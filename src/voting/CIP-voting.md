# `Governance API`

These definitions extend [CIP 30 (Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge)](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) to provide specific support for vote delegation.
They enable the construction of transactions containing metadata that conforms to
[CIP 36 (Catalyst/Voltaire Registration Transaction Metadata Format - Updated)](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip36/),
enabling new functionality including vote delegation to either private or public representatives (dReps),
splitting or combining of private votes,
the use of different voting keys or delegations
for different purposes (Catalyst etc).

## **Namespace**


### cardano.{walletName}.governance.enable(): Promise\<API>



## `Types`

### **GovernanceKey**

```
type GovernanceKey = {
  voting_key: cbor<vkey>,
  weight: number
}

```

`voting_key`: Ed25519 pubkey 32 bytes HEX string  

`weight`: Used to calculate the actual voting power using the rules described
in 
[CIP 36](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip36/).


### **Purpose**

```
type enum Purpose = {
  CATALYST = 0,
  OTHER = 1
}

```

`Purpose`: Defines the purpose of the delegations. This is used to limit the scope of the delegations 


# **`API`**

## **api.getVotingKey**(address_index: number = 0, account: number = 0, role: number = 0): Promise<Bip32PublicKey>: Promise \<**cbor\<vkey>**>

Should derive and return the wallets voting public key

### **Returns**
`cbor\<vkey>` - cbor serialized 64 bytes (x, y) Ed25519 public key  

There should be only a single single voting key per wallet / mnemonic. 

The **`voting_key`** should be derived from the following path. 

```
m / 1694' / 1815' / account' / role' / address_index'
```

`1694` (year Voltaireâ€™s was born) Sets a dedicated `purpose` in the derivation path for the voting profile.  

`address_index` - index of the key to use. 


## **api.buildDelegation**(keys: GovernanceKey[], purpose: Purpose, networkId: number, stakeAccountPath: number = 0, stakeRolePath: number = 0, stakeIndex: number = 0): Promise\<**`Delegation`**>

Should create the metadata object to be submitted by a metadata transaction to register the delegations on-chain. 

### **Params**

`account`: In case the wallet supports multiple accounts. defaults to 0

`chain`: Part of the derivation path. defaults to 0

`role`: 

### **Returns**

#### **`Delegation`**

```
export interface Delegation {
    voting_delegation: GovernanceKey[],
    staking_key: string,
    reward_address: string,
    nonce: number,
    purpose: Purpose
}
```

Defines the structure to be crafted and signed for delegation of voting & their respectively voting power. 

***`voting_delegation`***: List of keys and their voting weight to delegate voting power to

The ***`staking_key`*** is Ed25519 public key 32bytes (x only) associated with your staking address. Defined in `CIP-11`, which specifies the derivation path for the staking key: 

```
m / 1852' / 1815' / account' / chain / 0
```

The ***`reward_address`*** as specified in `CIP-8` [here](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip8/#addressformats) 


The ***`nonce`*** is an unsigned integer (of CBOR major type 0) that should be monotonically rising across all transactions with the same staking key. It's up to the wallet to manage this and to guarantee that these are always unique and higher than the previous one. An advised nonce value is `linux epoch timestamp`.


## **api.signDelegation**(delegation: DelegationMetadata, account: number = 0, role: number = 0, index: number = 0): Promise\<**`SignedDelegationMetadata`**>

Given that since `CIP-18`, multi-staking keys should be considered; but that a single voting profile should exist per wallet. A single staking key should be used to perform EDDSA over the voting profile blake2b-256 hash.

The staking key used should still be the one defined in `CIP-11`. 

### **Returns**

#### **`SignedDelegationMetadata`**

```
export interface SignedDelegationMetadata {
    '61284': DelegationMetadata,
    '61285': string
}
```

Defines the result of signing the DelegationMetadata.

`61284`: Key that defines the registration metadata map

`61285`: Signature of the blake2b hash of the `DelegationMetadata`

### api.submitMetadataTx(tx: cbor\<transaction>): Promise\<hash32>

Errors: `APIError`, `TxSendError`

This should be trigger a request to the wallet to submit a raw cbor-encoded metadata tx. The wallet may refuse or accept the request. 

### Voting profile signing process

1. **`Get Voting Key`** - use the method **api.getVotingKey** to return a ed25519 32 bytes public key (x value of the point on the curve)

2. **`Craft delegation cert`** - Use **api.buildDelegation** to construct the object containing the key array set to delegate voting power to. Each value will express the `weight` of the voting powers given.

3. **`Sign the delegation cert`** - Use **api.signDelegation** sign the blake2b hash of the delegation cert and append it to the cert

4. **`Encode`** - Cbor encode the cert to be used in the metadata transaction

5. **`Broad cast metadata tx`** - Push metadata transaction
